Tutorial will also explain and show you how to sign/broadcast transaction on **Crea** blockchain using the [crea-python](https://github.com/creativechain/crea-python) library.

## Intro

Crea python library has built-in function to commit transaction and broadcast it to the network. 

## Steps

1.  [**App setup**](#app-setup) - Library install and import
1.  [**Post list**](#post-list) - List of posts to select from popular filter 
1.  [**Enter user credentials**](#credentials-list) - Enter user credentails to sign transaction

#### 1. App setup <a name="app-setup"></a>

In this tutorial we use 3 packages, `pick` - helps us to select filter interactively. `crea` - crea-python library, interaction with Blockchain. `pprint` - print results in better format.

First we import all three library and initialize Crea class

```python
    import pprint
    from pick import pick
    # initialize Crea class
    from crea import Crea

    s = Crea()
```

#### 2. Post list <a name="post-list"></a>


Next we will fetch and make list of accounts and setup `pick` properly.

```python
    query = {
      "limit":5, #number of posts
      "tag":"" #tag of posts
    }
    # post list from popular post list
    posts = s.get_discussions_by_popular(query)

    title = 'Please choose post to reblog: '
    options = []
    # post list
    for post in posts:
      options.append('@'+post["author"]+'/'+post["permlink"])

```

This will show us list of posts to select in terminal/command prompt. And after selection we will get formatted post as an `option` variable.

#### 3. Enter user credentials <a name="credentials-list"></a>

Next in order to sign transaction, application asks for username and posting private key to sign transaction and broadcast it.

```python
  # get index and selected post
  option, index = pick(options, title)
  pprint.pprint("You selected: "+option)

  account = input("Enter your username? ")
  wif = input("Enter your Posting private key? ")

  # commit or build transaction
  c = Commit(crea=Crea(keys=[wif]))

  # broadcast transaction
  c.recrea(option, account=account)

```


That's it, if transaction is successful you shouldn't see any error messages, otherwise you will be notified.

### To Run the tutorial

1.  [review dev requirements](getting_started)
1.  clone this repo
1.  `cd tutorials/14_reblogging_post`
1.  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
