The purpose of this tutorial is to **a)** demonstrate how to get a list of articles from the trending list on the blockchain, and **b)** fetch the voters of the selected post to display the account and date at which they voted.

We will also explain the most commonly used fields from the response object.

## Intro

Each post has voters that support content and play big role in reward distribution. Getting details of each voter and their vote value, time, etc. is another crucial information for authors and app developers. We will be using `get_active_votes` API call to retrieve that information right from Crea blockchain.

## Steps

1.  [**Fetching posts**](#fetching-posts) Get trending post list
1.  [**Voter information**](#voter-info) Voters information on selected post
1.  [**Query result**](#query-result) Example of result from query

#### 1. Fetching posts<a name="fetching-posts"></a>

As mentioned in our previous tutorial we can fetch various lists of posts with different filters. Here, we are reusing some parts of that tutorial to list the top 5 trending posts.

```javascript
var query = {
    tag: '', // This tag is used to filter the results by a specific post tag.
    limit: 5, // This allows us to limit the total to 5 items.
    truncate_body: 1, // This will truncate the body of each post to 1 character, which is useful if you want to work with lighter array.
};
```

#### 2. Voter information<a name="voter-info"></a>

On selection of a particular post from the list, `openPost` function is fired. This function will call the `get_active_votes` function to fetch the voters of the post. `get_active_votes` requires author and permlink of the post to fetch its data.

```javascript
client.database.call('get_active_votes', [author, permlink]).then(result => {
    console.log('votes', result, JSON.stringify(result));

    var voters = [];
    voters.push(
        `<div class='pull-right'><button onclick=goback()>Close</button></div><br>`
    );
    result.forEach(voter => {
        const name = voter.voter;
        const time = new Date(voter.time).toDateString();
        voters.push(`${name} (${time})`);
    });

    document.getElementById('postList').style.display = 'none';
    document.getElementById('postBody').style.display = 'block';
    document.getElementById('postBody').innerHTML = voters.join('<li>');
});
```

```javascript
document.getElementById('postList').style.display = 'block';
document.getElementById('postBody').style.display = 'none';
```

The "go back" function simply hides and shows the post list.

#### 3. Query result<a name="query-result"></a>

The result is returned from the post content as a `JSON` object with the following properties:

```json
[
    {
        "voter": "gekko",
        "weight": 157,
        "rshares": 2626899959,
        "percent": 10000,
        "reputation": "1185517433922",
        "time": "2018-05-08T07:16:09"
    },
    {
        "voter": "embat",
        "weight": 154,
        "rshares": 2578364521,
        "percent": 10000,
        "reputation": "161340267374",
        "time": "2018-05-08T07:38:24"
    }
]
```

From this result, you have access to everything associated with the selected post, including additional metadata which is a `JSON` string that must be decoded to use.

*   `voter` - The author account name of the vote.
*   `weight` - Weight of the voting power.
*   `rshares` - Reward shares.
*   `percent` - Percent of vote.
*   `reputation` - The [reputation](https://developers.creaproject.io/glossary/#reputation) of the account that voted.
*   `time` - Time the vote was submitted.
