### Intro

This tutorial fetches the contents of a single post and explains all data related to that post.

We will also describe the most commonly used fields from the response object.

### Making the api call

To request a specific post we use the `get_content` method:

```ruby
api = Radiator::Api.new

api.get_content(author, permlink) do |content|
  # .
  # ... your code here
  # .
end
```

#### Example api call
If we want to get the post "announcing-the-crea-developer-portal" by user @crearydev
```ruby
api.get_content("crearydev", "announcing-the-crea-developer-portal") do |content| ...
```

#### Example api call using script
And to do the same with our tutorial script
```bash
ruby get_post_details.rb https://creary.net/creadev/@crearydev/announcing-the-crea-developer-portal
```

#### Example Output

From the example we get the following output from our script

```

### Post fields

Most console applications that use the `get_content` method are probably looking for the `body` field.  But there are many other fields to look at.  Let's break them down by use:

#### `parent_author`

In our script (`get_post_details.rb`), we use the ruby statement:

```ruby
content.parent_author.empty?
```

With the above idiom, your application can determine if the content is a root post or reply.  If it's empty, then you're working with a root post, otherwise, it's a reply.

Once you know you're dealing with a reply, other fields can be useful for additional details.  For instance, `root_author`, `root_permlink`, and `root_title` can be used to figure out what the original post details are, even if the reply is deeply nested.

#### `last_update` and `created`

In our script, we use the ruby statement:

```ruby
content.last_update == content.created
```

With the above idiom, your application can determine if the content has been modified since it was originally posted.  If they are the same, then there has been no modification.

#### `cashout_time`

In our script, we use the ruby statement:

```ruby
(cashout = Time.parse(content.cashout_time + 'Z') - Time.now.utc) > 0
```

With the above idiom, you can use `cashout_time` to determine if the content has reached payout.  If `cashout_time` is in the future, the content has not been paid yet.  You can determine the possible future payout by inspecting `pending_payout_value`.

You will note that we must parse the string found in `content.cashout_time` by appending `Z` (Zulu Time, aka UTC) in order for `Time.parse` to get the right timezone.

Even before payout, you can determine what the `max_accepted_payout` is.  Most often, this is set to one of two values by the author:

* `1000000.000 CBD` - Accepted Payout
* `0.000 CBD` - Declined Payout

In addition to `max_accepted_payout`, the author may specify how much of the author reward should be in CREA Power or liquid rewards.  The most common settings are:

* `10000` - Maximum Liquid Reward
* `0` - CREA Power Only

Once the payout time has arrived, it's possible to determine the split between author and curation by inspecting at `author_rewards` and `curator_payout_value`.

#### `beneficiaries`

In our script, we use the ruby statement:

```ruby
content.beneficiaries.any?
```

Some content will have a `beneficiaries` array.  This is used to determine reward routes any account, up to eight.  Payouts are in CREA Power and are expressed as a reward percentage of the author reward.

To display a list of who the beneficiaries are, use the following ruby code, as seen in the example:

```ruby
content.beneficiaries.each do |beneficiary|
  puts "\t\t#{beneficiary.account}: #{'%.2f %' % (beneficiary.weight / 100.0)}"
end
```

Note, if you just want an array of beneficiary account names, this will work in a pinch:

```ruby
accounts = content.beneficiaries.map do |beneficiary|
  beneficiary.account
end
```

#### `active_votes`

In our script, we use the ruby statements:

```ruby
votes = content.active_votes
upvotes = votes.select { |v| v.percent > 0 }.size
downvotes = votes.select { |v| v.percent < 0 }.size
unvotes = votes.select { |v| v.percent == 0 }.size
top_voter = votes.sort_by { |v| v.rshares.to_i }.last.voter
```

The above idiom splits all vote types and identifies the top voter.  This is because the `active_votes` field is an array that shows all votes applied to the content, including upvotes, downvotes, and unvotes (where a vote previously cast is revoked).

#### `json_metadata`

In our script, we use the ruby statements:

```ruby
metadata = JSON[content.json_metadata || '{}'] rescue {}
tags = metadata['tags'] || []
app = metadata['app']
```

As you can see from the above example, `json_metadata` starts out as a string of JSON that can be parsed to determine things like `tags` and `app`.  Other data may be present, depending on the application that created the content.

Note, we're using `rescue` in case the `json_metadata` string contains invalid JSON because there is no validation performed on this field by the blockchain when content is broadcasted.


### To Run

First, set up your workstation using the steps provided in [Getting Started](https://developers.creaproject.io/tutorials-ruby/getting_started).  Then you can create and execute the script (or clone from this repository):

*`<content-url>` 

```bash
git clone git@github.com:creary/devportal-tutorials-rb.git
cd devportal-tutorials-rb/tutorials/05_get_post_details
bundle install
ruby get_post_details.rb <content-url>
```
