### Making the api call

To broadcast the operation, we can use a `Radiator::Transaction` instance:

```ruby
tx = Radiator::Transaction.new


tx.process(true)
```

Passing `true` to `Radiator::Transaction#process` will broadcast the operations queued in the `operations` array of the transaction.

#### Example api call

If we want to vote, for example:

```ruby
tx.operations << {
  type: :vote,
  voter: voter,
  author: author,
  permlink: permlink,
  weight: weight
}
```

#### Example api call using script

And to do the same with our tutorial script:

```bash
ruby vote_on_content.rb https://creary.net/@inertia/kinda-spooky
```

#### Example Output

From the example we get the following output from our script:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "id": "244a67bf1e64f05fb2ab52a0652a8edd30c5d273",
    "block_num": 27035223,
    "trx_num": 15,
    "expired": false
  },
  "id": 3
}
```

The response we get after broadcasting the transaction gives us the transaction id ([`244a67b...`](https://cread.com/tx/244a67bf1e64f05fb2ab52a0652a8edd30c5d273)), block number ([`27035223`](https://cread.com/b/27035223)), and the transaction number of that block (`15`).

Note, this script accepts accepts an optional percentage (defaulting `100.0 %`).  To set the vote to `50.0 %`:

```bash
ruby vote_on_content.rb https://creary.net/@inertia/kinda-spooky 50
```

### Example Error

If an invalid vote weight is given (e.g.: `101 %`), we will get back an error:

```json

  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "error": {
    "code": -32000,

                    "weight": 10100
                  }
                }
              ],

              "signatures": [

              ]
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "id": 3
}
```

This indicates that the operation was not included in the blockchain because it was given an invalid weight argument.

### Vote Fields

Broadcasting a `vote` operation will require the following fields:

* `voter` - account that is doing the vote op
* `author` - author of the post being voted for
* `permlink` - permlink of the post being voted for
* `weight` - percentage of one vote being cast, expressed as an integer (e.g.: `100.0 %` = `10000`)

### To Run

First, set up your workstation using the steps provided in [Getting Started](https://developers.creaproject.io/tutorials-ruby/getting_started).  Then you can create and execute the script (or clone from this repository) with the following arguments:

* `<url>` - the URL to vote on
* `[weight]` - the weight of the vote as percentage, optional (default `100.0 %`)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:creary/devportal-tutorials-rb.git
cd devportal-tutorials-rb/tutorials/17_vote_on_content
bundle install
ruby vote_on_content.rb <url> [weight]
```
