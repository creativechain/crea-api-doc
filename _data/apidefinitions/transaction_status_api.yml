- name: :transaction_status_api
  description: |
    This API is intended to evaluate a transaction status after calling [`condenser_api.broadcast_transaction`]({{ '/apidefinitions/#condenser_api.broadcast_transaction' | relative_url }}).
    
    To enable this API for `cread`, the following is required in `config.ini` by specifying:
    
    ```ini
    plugin = transaction_status_api
    ```
    
    See: [#3060](https://github.com/creativechain/crea/pull/3060)
  methods:
  - api_method: transaction_status_api.find_transaction

    purpose: |
      Returns the status of a given transaction id.  Parameters: `trx_id:string`; `expiration:timestamp` (optional)

      | `within_mempool` | Transaction in mempool |
      | `within_reversible_block` | Transaction has been included in block, block not irreversible |
      | `within_irreversible_block` | Transaction has been included in block, block is irreversible |
      | `expired_reversible` | Transaction has expired, transaction is not irreversible (transaction could be in a fork) |
